## Overview

This is a Flutter application for managing a todo list. The app is designed following the Clean Architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

## Folder Structure
```css

│   └── domain
│       └── utils
│           └── utils.dart
|   └── infrastructure

### Explanation of the Layers

- **Common Layer**:
   - Contains utility functions and shared code that can be used across different parts of the app.
  - Deals with the storage mechanisms, such as Hive for local data persistence. Includes abstract classes and repositories for managing data operations.

- **Todo List Feature**:
   - **Domain Layer**:
     - Contains the core business logic and models related to the todo list feature.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**:
     - Manages the state of tasks and specific storage implementation for tasks.
   - **Presentation Layer**:
     - Manages the user interface components related to the todo list, such as dialogs for adding, deleting, and editing tasks, the main screen, and individual task items.

4. **Main Entry Point**:
   - The entry point of the Flutter application, responsible for initializing and running the app.
